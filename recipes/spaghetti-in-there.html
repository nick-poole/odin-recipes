                  <p>This one hits way too close to home. Growing up, your mom made a whole pot of spaghetti on a weeknight after school. 
                     Now, don't get the wrong idea, you love this spaghetti. It's Mom's and you have consumed this one dish more than any other dish in the world. Its fresh, its hot. There is even Texas Toast coming hot out of the oven. 
                     
   
   
                     See? This is a Mom cheat code. 
    
                     But all the noodles are gone! 
                     
                     It's Ok, we can boil some more. 
   
                     We ate all the sauce? I can add another jar. 
                     
                     
                     It does not matter what day it is or how many times youve eaten it. 
   
   
                     Mom isn't cooking when she gets home and she's not stopping at the drive thru. There's spaghetti in there and as God as my witness, you're going to eat it.
