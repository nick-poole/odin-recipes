                  <p>This one hits way too close to home. Growing up, your mom would make a whole pot of 
                     spaghetti on a weeknight after school. You love this spaghetti! It's your Mom's, after all,
                     and it might even be safe to say that you have consumed this one dish more than any other 
                     in your entire life. With a piece of garlic toast and some parmesan cheese, you have a 
                     world class home cooked meal!
                     </p>
                  
                  <p>Homemade spaghetti is typically made in abundance which means there is usually a good 
                     amount left over for consumption the following day(s). So if you ever get hungry, there's 
                     spaghetti in there!

                     A mother is under no obligation to cook if food is readily available. By this very fact, 
                     the availability and close proximity of food is what directly negates her child's hunger.

                     
                     This is a classic Mom cheat code and it can be extended so long as individual ingredients 
                     remain in supply. More sauce can be added and more pasta can be boiled if either are 
                     depleted before the other.

                     In a recent study, nutritionists have discovered that a single pot of Mom's spaghetti can 
                     feed a household of 4 for over a week. This phenomenon makes perfect sense when factoring
                     in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics">supply side economics</a>, 
                     the law of conservation of leftovers, and 
                     <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07468342.2008.11922273?journalCode=ucmj20">
                      the depletion ratio</a>.

                     Strictly speaking, it is a mother's duty to feed her child(ren).
                     However the parameters do not specify whether that meal is required to be <i>new</i> or 
                     even how a <i>new</i> meal is defined.

                  <p>It does not matter how long it has been since it was made or how many times you've eaten it. 
                     Mom is <strong>not</strong> cooking when she gets home and she's <strong>not</strong> stopping 
                     at the drive thru. There's spaghetti in there and as God as my witness, you're going to eat it.
