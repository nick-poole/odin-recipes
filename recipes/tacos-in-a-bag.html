              <p>Before we begin, I just want to acknowledge that, yes, this is exactly what this looks like. 
                 But hear me out. It’s Tuesday. Or as it’s known in the United States, Taco Tuesday. 
                 After work, you stop by the store to grab taco ingredients. You know, the usual - ground beef, low fat sour cream, shredded cheese,  
                 you make it all the way home before you realize that the taco kit you bought didn’t (for whatever reason) include taco shells or tortillas.
                 Im gonna tell you what you ar not going to do. You aren’t getting back in your ‘03 Honda Civic and driving all the way to the store for taco shells. 
                 That’s madness and madness is not what taco Tuesday is all about.</p>
