                         <p>Before we begin, I just want to acknowledge that, yes, this is exactly what this looks like. 
                            But hear me out. Suppose it tuesday, and by tuesday I mean Taco tuesday. After work, you stop 
                            by the store to grab taco ingredients. You know, the usual - ground beef, low fat sour cream, 
                            shredded cheese, etc. You make it all the way home before you realize that the taco kit you 
                            bought didn’t (for whatever reason) include taco shells or tortillas. I'm gonna tell you what 
                            you are not going to do. You aren’t getting back in your ‘03 Honda Civic and driving all the way
                            to the store for taco shells. That’s madness and madness is not what taco Tuesday is all about.
                            </p>
                            
                            <blockquote>Don't worry. We've got you covered.</blockquote>

                         <p>This recipe takes the traditional approach to taco tuesday and incorporates a unique twist. 
                            It is perfect for casual social events or any taco sitaution that lacks shells or tortillas.
                            If you have taco ingredients and a variety pack of mini Dorito &trade;,(or Fritos &#174; - we 
                            don't judge) then you have all you need for this tasty occasion. </p>
